The following is a plan for creating and using a user-assigned managed identity in Azure.

## üìù **Create the Managed Identity**

1.  **Create a User-Assigned Managed Identity:** In the Azure portal, navigate to **Managed Identities** and create a new one. Provide a name and choose the appropriate subscription and resource group.
2.  **Verify the Identity's Existence:** After creation, locate the new identity in the **Managed Identities** blade to confirm it was successfully created.

***

## üîê **Assign Permissions**

1.  **Identify the Target Resource:** Determine which Azure resource (e.g., a Storage Account, Key Vault) the managed identity needs to access.
2.  **Assign a Role:** Navigate to the target resource and go to its **Access control (IAM)** settings. Click **+ Add** to add a role assignment.
3.  **Configure Role Assignment:**
    * Select the appropriate **role** (e.g., 'Storage Blob Data Reader' for a Storage Account).
    * Choose **Managed identity** as the 'Assign access to' option.
    * Select the user-assigned managed identity you created earlier.
    * Save the changes to grant the identity the necessary permissions.

## üíª **Utilize the Managed Identity**

1.  **Assign the Identity to an Azure Resource:**
    * Choose an Azure resource that will use the identity, such as a Virtual Machine, Azure App Service, or Azure Function.
    * In the resource's settings, navigate to the **Identity** section.
    * Enable the **User-assigned** tab and select the managed identity you created.
    * Save the settings to link the identity to the resource.
2.  **Access Resources from Code:**
    * Within the application code running on the assigned resource, use the Azure SDK or a REST API call to authenticate using the managed identity. The SDK will automatically handle the process of obtaining an access token without requiring any hardcoded credentials.
    * Use the acquired token to make authorized calls to the target resource (e.g., reading a secret from Azure Key Vault).

Of course. Here is a project example with detailed guidelines for implementing a user-assigned managed identity.

### **Project Scenario**

You have a web application hosted on an **Azure App Service** that needs to securely access data from an **Azure Storage Account** without using any hardcoded credentials in the application's code or configuration files. The goal is to use a user-assigned managed identity to achieve this.

### **Guidelines and Action Plan**

**Phase 1: Azure Resource Provisioning**

1.  **Create an Azure Resource Group:** This will be the container for all your resources.

2.  **Create a User-Assigned Managed Identity:**

      * Give it a descriptive name (e.g., `AppServiceStorageIdentity`).
      * Place it in the same resource group as your other resources for easy management.

3.  **Create an Azure Storage Account:**

      * Choose a unique name for the storage account.
      * For this project, a **General-purpose v2** account is a good choice.
      * Create a container within the storage account (e.g., `my-app-data`).

4.  **Create an Azure App Service:**

      * Choose a unique name for your web app.
      * Select a runtime stack (e.g., .NET, Node.js, Python) that you will use for your application.
      * Place it in the same resource group.

**Phase 2: Access Control Configuration**

1.  **Assign the Identity to the App Service:**

      * In the Azure portal, navigate to your App Service.
      * Go to the **Identity** section in the settings menu.
      * Select the **User assigned** tab.
      * Click **+ Add** and select the `AppServiceStorageIdentity` you created earlier.
      * Save the changes. This links the App Service to the managed identity.

2.  **Grant the Identity Access to the Storage Account:**

      * Navigate to your Storage Account.
      * Go to **Access control (IAM)**.
      * Click **+ Add** and then **Add role assignment**.
      * On the **Role** tab, select the role that provides the necessary permissions. For this example, a good choice is the **Storage Blob Data Reader** role. This allows the identity to read data from the storage account but not modify or delete it.
      * On the **Members** tab, select **Managed identity** for the "Assign access to" field.
      * Click **+ Select members**, choose the `AppServiceStorageIdentity`, and then click **Select**.
      * Click **Review + assign** to complete the role assignment.

**Phase 3: Application Development**

1.  **Develop the Web Application:**

      * Create a simple application (e.g., a web page) that needs to read a file from the `my-app-data` container in the storage account.
      * Use the Azure SDK for your chosen programming language. The key here is to use the SDK's identity library, which will automatically detect and use the managed identity. You will not need to provide a connection string, access key, or secret.

2.  **Example Code Snippet (Python):**

    ```python
    import os
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
    from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient

    # No credentials needed! The DefaultAzureCredential will
    # automatically use the managed identity when running on Azure.

    # Get the storage account URL from an environment variable (best practice)
    storage_account_url = os.environ.get("STORAGE_ACCOUNT_URL")
    container_name = "my-app-data"
    blob_name = "example.txt"

    # Use the managed identity to get a credential
    credential = DefaultAzureCredential()

    # Create a BlobServiceClient using the managed identity credential
    blob_service_client = BlobServiceClient(account_url=storage_account_url, credential=credential)

    # Get a client for the specific container
    container_client = blob_service_client.get_container_client(container_name)

    # Download and print the content of the blob
    try:
        blob_client = container_client.get_blob_client(blob_name)
        stream = blob_client.download_blob()
        print(stream.readall().decode("utf-8"))
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error accessing blob: {e}")
    ```

3.  **Configure Application Settings:**

      * Go to the App Service's **Configuration** section.
      * Add an application setting named `STORAGE_ACCOUNT_URL` with the URL of your storage account (e.g., `https://<your-storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net`).
      * This ensures that the application code can find the storage account to connect to, but it still doesn't require a secret.

4.  **Deploy the Application:**

      * Deploy your code to the Azure App Service.
      * The application should now be able to run and successfully read the `example.txt` file from the storage container, using the managed identity for authentication.

### **Verification and Testing**

  * **Initial Test:** Access your web application's URL. It should display the content of the `example.txt` file.
  * **Remove Permissions:** To prove the security model, go back to the Storage Account's **Access control (IAM)**, remove the `Storage Blob Data Reader` role assignment for your managed identity, and save.
  * **Re-Test:** Access your web application again. This time, it should fail to read the file and display an error message, demonstrating that the access was tied directly to the role assignment, not a hardcoded secret.
  * **Re-assign Permissions:** Add the role assignment back to restore the application's functionality.
