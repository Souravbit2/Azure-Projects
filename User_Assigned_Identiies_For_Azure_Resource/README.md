The following is a plan for creating and using a user-assigned managed identity in Azure.

## üìù **Create the Managed Identity**

1.  **Create a User-Assigned Managed Identity:** In the Azure portal, navigate to **Managed Identities** and create a new one. Provide a name and choose the appropriate subscription and resource group.
2.  **Verify the Identity's Existence:** After creation, locate the new identity in the **Managed Identities** blade to confirm it was successfully created.

## üîê **Assign Permissions**

1.  **Identify the Target Resource:** Determine which Azure resource (e.g., a Storage Account, Key Vault) the managed identity needs to access.
2.  **Assign a Role:** Navigate to the target resource and go to its **Access control (IAM)** settings. Click **+ Add** to add a role assignment.
3.  **Configure Role Assignment:**
    * Select the appropriate **role** (e.g., 'Storage Blob Data Reader' for a Storage Account).
    * Choose **Managed identity** as the 'Assign access to' option.
    * Select the user-assigned managed identity you created earlier.
    * Save the changes to grant the identity the necessary permissions.

## üíª **Utilize the Managed Identity**

1.  **Assign the Identity to an Azure Resource:**
    * Choose an Azure resource that will use the identity, such as a Virtual Machine, Azure App Service, or Azure Function.
    * In the resource's settings, navigate to the **Identity** section.
    * Enable the **User-assigned** tab and select the managed identity you created.
    * Save the settings to link the identity to the resource.
2.  **Access Resources from Code:**
    * Within the application code running on the assigned resource, use the Azure SDK or a REST API call to authenticate using the managed identity. The SDK will automatically handle the process of obtaining an access token without requiring any hardcoded credentials.
    * Use the acquired token to make authorized calls to the target resource (e.g., reading a secret from Azure Key Vault).
